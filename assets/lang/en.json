    "betkanu_text2":"Our History:",
    "betkanu_description2":"A group of friends noticed the loss of the spoken Syriac language in diaspora, to the extent that UNESCO designated it as a \"severely endangered language\", found the need to create a change.\n In order to help Syriac succeed in the digital age, BET KANU was established in 2017 to build a foundation to advance the main dialects of the Syriac language(Eastern/Western). \nWith a dedicated BET KANU Center in the homeland, a dozen of our local talented designers, animators, and developers along with volunteers in the diaspora, create multi-media products and modern resources that Syriac lacks.This center, more importantly, provides hope through job opportunities and youth empowerment in times of war",
